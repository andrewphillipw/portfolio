Empathize with the End User

Mobile is where the users are moving to; they have their heads in their phones, not their laptops.

In short, everything needs to be designed for mobile firs. This is different than just doing a 
responsive retrofitting (converting desktop to mobile), which does not prioritize catering to
mobile users (the number of users will only continue to increase due to low-cost & ease of use).

Anything that can be done to make it easier for the user should be done: reducing the cognitive
load, creating seamless interface, and increasing reachability.

Some examples of this:

RELEVANT - an easier form; ask for only ESSENTIALS

IMMEDIATE - pulling up the large numpad for number fields

FRICTIONLESS - moving the menu bar to the bottom so it's REACHABLE
